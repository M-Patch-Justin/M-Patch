To call the automatically generated contract interface, first initialize a transaction object, and then call the generated contract interface.
Even if the called contract function does not change the state of the blockchain, a transaction object needs to be initialized first.

Take Ethereum as an example (different blockchain protocol parameters are different):

BIOT_RESULT BiotEthTxInit(BiotEthWallet *wallet_ptr,
                          BiotEthTx *tx_ptr,
                          BBOOL is_sync_tx,
                          BCHAR *gasprice_str,
                          BCHAR *gaslimit_str,
                          BCHAR *recipient_str)
                          
                          parameter name	Parameter Description
wallet_ptr	The wallet pointer that this transaction is combined with.
tx_ptr	Pointer a transaction object.
is_sync_tx	For a stateful transaction, specify BIOT_TRUE to wait until the transaction is mined.
Specifiy BIOT_FALSE to allow multiple transactions to be sent continuously in a short time.
For a state-less contract call, this option is ignored.
gasprice	A HEX string representing the gas price (unit: wei) to be used in the transaction.
Set <gasprice> = NULL to obtain gas price from network.
BiotEthTxSetGasPrice() can later be called to modify the gas price at any time before the transaction is executed.
gaslimit	A HEX string representing the gas limit to be used in the transaction.
BiotEthTxSetGasLimit() can later be called to modify the gas limit at any time before the transaction is executed.
recipient_str	A HEX string representing the recipient address, in HEX format like"0x19c91A4649654265823512a457D2c16981bB64F5".
BiotEthTxSetRecipient() can later be called to modify the recipient at any time before the transaction is executed.
return value: This function returns BIOT_SUCCESS if initialization is successful. Otherwise it returns one of the error codes.

E.g. :

BiotEthTx tx_ctx;
BIOT_RESULT result;
result = BiotEthTxInit(wallet_ptr,
                       &tx_ctx,
                       BIOT_TRUE,
                       NULL,
                       "0x333333",
                       "0x9e7f3ae22cf97939a2e4cd68dd33bb29268a1ec9");
Call Contract Interface

After completing the transaction initialization, you can call the automatically generated contract interface:

E.g. :

BCHAR *result_str;
result_str = StoreRead_saveList(&tx_ctx, (BUINT8 *)"HelloWorld");
