If the SDK is ported to RTOS, the following points should generally be followed:

1. Remove The Dependency On Curl

curl is a communication protocol library under Linux, used in the SDK to support http/https communication. Blockchain nodes usually use the http/https protocol to communicate.

For modules using RTOS, you should add a call package to the module's http/https interface in<SDKRoot>/vendor/platform/<platform_name>/src/rpc, and modify <SDKRoot>/vendor/platform/<platform_name>/scripts/gen.py, close RPC_USE_LIBCURL and set the new RPC USE OPTION.

2. Remove Dependence on The File System

The SDK uses files as a persistent storage method for the wallet. If the RTOS does not support the file system, you should modify the file operation related to  BiotGetFileSize , BiotWriteFile , BiotReadFile , BiotRemoveFile ,from <SDKRoot>/vendor/platform/<platform_name>/port_xx/biotplatform_internal.c, modify the read/write file to the persistence method supported by the system.

3. Memory Trimming

If the memory of the target system is too tight to load, you can try to trim the memory. The points that can be cropped include:

a) According to actual needs, in <SDKRoot>/makefile, close the blockchain protocol that does not need to be supported b) According to the actual situation, reduce the storage space BOAT_XXX_NODE_URL_MAX_LEN of the node URL string in <SDKRoot>/api_<protocol>.h c) According to actual needs, reduce the number of wallets BIOT_MAX_WALLET_NUM in <SDKRoot>/include/biotwallet.h d) According to the actual situation, reduce the maximum number of members supported in a LIST in <SDKRoot>/include/biotrlp.h MAX_RLP_LIST_DESC_NUM e) According to the actual situation, reduce the self-increment step size of web3 data buffer in /sdk/protocol/common/web3intf/web3intf.h WEB3_STRING_BUF_STEP_SIZE

If After The Above Cropping, The Memory is Still Too Large To Fit, Please Try:

a) According to actual needs, the simple RLP encoding method for specific transaction parameters is used to replace the recursive general RLP encoding method in <SDKRoot>/sdk/rlp
b) According to actual needs, tailor the APIs that are not actually used
