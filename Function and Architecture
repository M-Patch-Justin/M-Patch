Supported Target Operating System:
Linux
RTOS

Supported Build Operating System:
Linux/Cygwin

Main features:
Blockchain account (wallet) parameter configuration
Blockchain key pair generation
Blockchain account creation/loading/unloading
Transfer transaction
Smart contract call (automatically generate C call interface)
Smart contract call (manual construction)
